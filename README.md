## Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and folks at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports to prove it! This project attempts to put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

The collection of data is too large to search through manually. One of the most common complaints from dedicated user community is that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

This project creates a table dynamically based upon collected data. Users will be able to filter the table data for specific values.


## Project Activities

* Create a landing  web page.

* Using the UFO dataset populate the table on the web page.

* The table displays `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Provide ability to filter data. The user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
